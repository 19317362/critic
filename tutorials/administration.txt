System Administration
=====================

Upgrading Critic
----------------

To install a newer version of Critic, simply check out a newer commit in the
<code>critic.git</code> repository clone from which Critic was installed, and
then run the command

| python upgrade.py

as root.  If the repository clone from which Critic was installed has been
deleted, upgrading Critic from a newly cloned repository will usually work as
well.  The only case in which this does not work is if the commit that was
installed (or last upgraded to) is not available in the newly cloned repository.

Upgrading Actions
-----------------
The actions taken by the <code>upgrade.py</code> are roughly these, in this
order:

1 Offer to create a backup copy (dump) of Critic's database,
2 install additional prerequisite software the the new version depends on,
3 ask questions for new configuration settings in the new version,
4 copy updated source files (to
    <code>%(configuration.paths.INSTALL_DIR)s/</code>),
5 write updated configuration files (to
    <code>%(configuration.paths.CONFIG_DIR)s/configuration/</code>)
  and other system files (e.g. Apache site definition file, SysV init script,
  <code>/usr/bin/criticctl</code>),
6 restart Apache and Critic background services, and
7 run migration scripts to update the database schema or perform other one-time
  system updating tasks.

Each of these steps could be empty, and thus skipped, depending on the changes
between the currently installed version of Critic and the new version.

Locally Modified Files
----------------------
If the upgrade process wants to write an updated version of an installed file,
it will first check if the currently installed file has been modified since it
was installed.  No local modification are reverted without asking first.  Note
though that modified configuration files can be modified without asking if this
can be done in a way that does not conflict with, and that preserves, the local
modifications.

Migration Scripts
-----------------
Some changes to the system requires custom modifications during an upgrade to
adjust the installed system to match how the new version of Critic would have
set the system up if it had been installed from scratch.  The most common such
change is changes to the database schema, such as adding new tables or new
columns to existing tables.

This type of custom modifications are performed by running small one-time
scripts called migration scripts.  When upgrading to a new version of Critic,
all migration scripts that exist in the new version that didn't exist in the
previously installed version are executed as the final step of the upgrade.

If the upgrade process would run any migration script that modifies the database
schema, the offer to create a backup copy of Critic's database at the beginning
of the upgrade process has "yes" as its default choice instead of "no" as it
otherwise has.  It is strongly recommended that the offer is accepted, since the
changes made by such a migration script are generally not reversible in any
other than to restore an earlier backup copy of the database.

Users
-----

Critic has a user database containing records of the users of the system.  The
record for each user contains the (typically short) user name, the user's full
name (which is what is normally displayed) and the user's email address, which
is used when the system sends notifications to the user.

The user database is populated in different ways depending on how Critic was
configured to identify and authenticate users.  If Critic was configured to
authenticate users itself, then users must be added to the database manually by
a system administrator.  This can be done using the
  <code>criticctl</code>
utility (installed as
  <code>/usr/bin/criticctl</code>
by Critic's installation script):

| criticctl adduser --name=USERNAME --email=EMAIL --fullname=FULLNAME

  Note: The program will prompt for the user's password.  If any of the options
  are omitted, it will also prompt for that information.

If Critic was configured to let the Web server authenticate users, it instead
assumes that the
  <code>REMOTE_USER</code>
WSGI environment variable is set to the name of the accessing user, and
automatically creates a user record in its database if one doesn't already
exist.  In this scenario, there's typically no reason for the system
administrator to manually add users to Critic's database (but it's still
possible to do so.)  See
  <a href="/tutorial?item=customization#automatic_user_creation">the customization tutorial</a>
for details on this automatic user creation, and how it can be tweaked.

System Users
------------
Critic's user database doesn't necessarily have to match the system's user
database.  However, if access to the Git repositories is provided over SSH,
then, for the purpose of SSH authentication, there needs to be system users.
And in this case, for each system user who can push changes to the Git
repositories over SSH there must be a matching user in Critic's user database
with the same username.

Also note that system users that should be allowed to access the Git
repositories must be members of the
  <code>%(configuration.base.SYSTEM_GROUP_NAME)s</code>
system group.

Git Authors and Committers
--------------------------
Critic's user database doesn't necessarily contain records for every user
occurring as the author or committer of commits in the Git repositories, but
commits can be mapped to Critic users by matching the email addresses in the Git
commit meta-data.  Each Critic user can register any number of email addresses
that he or she uses or has used when creating Git commits.  By default, the
user's primary email address is used to map commits to the user, but the user is
in no way forced to use this particular email address in Git commits.

Currently, the only effect of mapping a commit's user references to a Critic
user is that a Critic user is never automatically assigned to review commits
that he/she is the author of.

Deleting Users
--------------
It is also possible to "delete" a user using <code>criticctl</code>:

| criticctl deluser --name=USERNAME

This doesn't actually delete the user record from the database, since that is
likely to be referenced from many places, depending on what the user has done in
the system.  Instead, what deleting a user does is

1 Marks the user as "retired", which prevents the system from acting as if the
  user is expected to be reviewing any changes in the future, and
2 deletes the user's password so that he or she can no longer sign in.

<strong>Important note:</strong> Deleting a user's password only prevents access
to the system if Critic handles user authentication.  If the Web server handles
it, the user must primarily be disabled in whatever mechanism the Web server
uses to authenticate users.  Critic will <b>not</b> disallow access in this
case.  What's more, in this case, if a deleted/retired user signs in, the user's
"retired" status is automatically reverted, thus completely undoing the effects
of "deleting" the user in the first place.

Roles
-----

User roles is a very basic access rights scheme, limiting which Critic users can
do a small number of things, including adding new repositories, modifying other
users' information, and adding news items.  Other than that, all users can
access all information in the system, modify all reviews and so on.

The available roles are:

? administrator
= A user with the <code>administrator</code> role can restart system background
  services via the
    <code><a href="/services">%(configuration.URL)s/services</a></code>
  page, edit other users' information via
    <code style='white-space: nowrap'>%(configuration.URL)s/home?user=&lt;name&gt;</code>
  and also enable/disable any tracked branch via
    <code><a href="/repositories">%(configuration.URL)s/repositories</a></code>.
  More exceptions are likely to be added in the future.

? repositories
= A user with the <code>repositories</code> role can add new repositories to the
  system via the
    <code><a href="/newrepository">%(configuration.URL)s/newrepository</a></code>
  page.

? newswriter
= A user with the <code>newswriter</code> role can write news items items that
  appear on the
    <code><a href="/news">%(configuration.URL)s/news</a></code>
  page.  The user can also edit existing items.  It is likely that news items
  will be also be added automatically when upgrading the system, to inform about
  significant changes.

? developer
= The <code>developer</code> role doesn't really give access to restricted
  functionality.  Instead it affects how unexpected errors -- such as uncaught
  Python exceptions -- are handled.  Normally, unexpected errors are presented
  to the user as just that, an "unexpected error," with a note that a message
  has been sent to the system administrator, and an email is sent to the system
  administrator with as much details as possible about the error.  But if the
  user triggering the error has the <code>developer</code> role, no email is
  sent to the system administrator (who is likely to be the same person in
  practice) and instead the error details -- typically a Python stack-trace --
  is displayed directly to the user.

Assigning Roles
---------------
To assign a role to a user, use the
  <code>criticctl</code>
utility:

| criticctl addrole --name=USERNAME --role=ROLE

and to unassign a role:

| criticctl delrole --name=USERNAME --role=ROLE

  Note: If the options are not provided, <code>criticctl</code> will instead
  prompt for the missing information.
