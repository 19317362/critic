Reconfiguring Critic
====================

Email Configuration
-------------------

When Critic sends emails about new or updated reviews, it generates a separate
email for every recipient.  (It then lies about whom it sent the email to by
adding all recipients to the "To" header in each email sent.)  You can configure
what changes you wish to receive emails about, to some degree what information
those emails should contain, and how the emails should be formatted.  Any such
configuration affects only emails sent to you.  They do not affect emails sent
to others because of things you do.

Email Activation
----------------
First of all you can configure whether emails are sent to you at all, using the
configuration item CONFIG(email.activated).  It's enabled by default, and you
should typically not disable it.

Subject Line Formats
--------------------
There are a number of configuration items that control the subject line of
emails sent.  Their names all start with "email.subjectLine.", for instance
CONFIG(email.subjectLine.newReview).

They all work the same way.  The value should be a valid
  <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#string-formatting">Python format string</a>
containing "%%(key)s" conversion specifiers to insert details about the review
into the subject line.  If the format string is invalid, instead of a useful
subject line your emails will contain the error message Python produced.

The following keys can be used in conversion specifiers:

? id
= The review ID in "r/NNNN" format.
? summary
= The review title or summary.
? progress
= The current progress of the review in "NN %% and N issues" format.
? branch
= The name of the review branch.
